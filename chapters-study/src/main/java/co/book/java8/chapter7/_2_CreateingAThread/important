■ If you need to define your own Thread rules upon which multiple tasks will rely, such
as a priority Thread, extending Thread may be preferable.
■■ Since Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, extending Thread does not allow you to
extend any other class, whereas implementing Runnable lets you extend another class.
■■ Implementing Runnable is often a better object-oriented design practice since it separates
the task being performed from the Thread object performing it.
■■ Implementing Runnable allows the class to be used by numerous Concurrency API
classes.
