Problem::::
How do we write code that creates objects in which the precise type of the object
may not be known until runtime?

Motivation:::: As you saw with the builder pattern, object creation can be quite complex.
Weâ€™d like some way of encapsulating object creation to deal with the complexity of
object creation, including selecting which subclass to use, as well as loosely coupling the
underlying creation implementation.

Solution::::
The factory pattern, sometimes referred to as the factory method pattern, is a
creational pattern based on the idea of using a factory class to produce instances of objects
based on a set of input parameters. It is similar to the builder pattern, although it is focused
on supporting class polymorphism.
Factory patterns are often, although
